        <h2><b>Top 5 Challenges Faced by Flower Distributors While Importing Flowers</b></h2>
        <p>1. Supply Uncertainty<br>
            During peak seasons of Valentine's Day, Women's Day and Mother's Day, etc., the demand for flowers is very high.<br> The growers, distributors, and wholesalers plan for these months in advance.<br> Because large floriculture depends on nature, any fluctuation in temperature, humidity, and rainfall, disturb the entire production schedule, <br>
            resulting in quality issues and less production. The short supply of flowers is one of the challenges every distributor has faced time and again.</p>
        <p>2. Packaging and Handling<br>
            Flowers, after harvesting, need proper handling and post-harvest treatment.<br> They have to be cooled, pruned, graded, bunched, appropriately packed, and stored in the cold room.<br> 
            Most clients or markets have a specific requirement for flowers and packing.</p>
         <p>3. Space constraint<br>
            Flowers are highly perishable. Flights are the most commonly used mode of transport.<br>
             Distributors lose market due to lack of space, causing flowers not to be shipped.</p>
         <p>4. Phytosanitary Inspection<br>
            When the shipment arrives at an importing country, it is inspected by Phyto officers to make sure <br>
            no pests or diseases enter the importing country.</p>
        <p>5. Custom clearance<br>
            For timely and hassle-free customs clearance, all the documents must be in place, and all the details on the documents must be accurate. <br>
            In case of any discrepancy, shipments are put on hold until the corrections are made</p>
