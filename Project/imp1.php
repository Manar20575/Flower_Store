        <p>1-Cut the stems:<br>
            Once you receive the flowers, make sure to cut the stems. Trim one or two inches off, also make sure to cut it at an angle,<br> since they are not sitting flat on the bottom of the vase, <br>cutting at an angle allows for better water intake.<br> It is the number one rule every florist in Cairo follows. Also, make sure to re-trim once every few days.</p><br>
    <p>2-Remove dead petals:<br>
        This prevents bacterial growth and makes your bouquet look way better.<br> Some flowers, like roses, have guard petals which are the two or three outermost petals of the flower.<br> Removing these will allow your flower to open up fully.<br> Make sure to check your flowers daily for dead leaves in order to avoid bacterial rot.</p>
        <p>3-Avoid direct sunlight:<br>
            Avoid displaying your flowers in direct sunlight, they will last longer in a room with a cool temperature.</p>
